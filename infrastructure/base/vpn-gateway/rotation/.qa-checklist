# VPN Rotator QA Checklist
# Run each command and mark status

## Rotation Commands
- [x] rotate:dry-run - Creates job, runs with DRY_RUN=true (WORKS)
- [ ] rotate:live - Creates job, actually rotates VPNs (BLOCKED - gluetun 401)

## Inspect Commands
- [x] inspect:pods - Lists rotation-enabled pods (WORKS)
- [x] inspect:secrets - Lists ProtonVPN server keys (WORKS)
- [x] inspect:state - Shows rotation state JSON (WORKS)
- [x] inspect:metrics - Shows Prometheus metrics (WORKS)
- [x] inspect:vpn-status - Shows current VPN exit per pod (FIXED - uses xargs)

## Service Commands
- [ ] port-forward:metrics - Forwards exporter to localhost:9091
- [ ] logs:exporter - Streams exporter logs

## Issues Found
1. ~~inspect:vpn-status - for loop doesn't work in Tilt cmd context~~ FIXED with xargs
2. rotate:live - gluetun API returns 401 Unauthorized
   - Need to set HTTP_CONTROL_SERVER_AUTH=false on all gluetun sidecars
   - Or set HTTP_CONTROL_SERVER_AUTH_USER + HTTP_CONTROL_SERVER_AUTH_PASSWORD
