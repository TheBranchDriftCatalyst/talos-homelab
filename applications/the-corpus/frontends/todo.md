- This frontends folder needs to be well fleshed out
- will probably utilize catalyst-ui (From ../catalyst-ui)
- I think here i want to create that k8 CRD FE proxy/toc server.
  - kind of like what was POCed in the catalyst-llm namespace
    this allows seeing them in the iframe... actually that could be 
    somethign we extract into the catalyst project space as well.


- i am leanign towards trying to use a real qiki engine for this, this is for visualizing the dynamically constructed corpus knowledge system.
