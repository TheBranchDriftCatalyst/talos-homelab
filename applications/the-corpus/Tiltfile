# The Corpus - Unified Tiltfile
#
# This orchestrates all sub-projects under the-corpus umbrella.
# Each sub-project can also be run independently via their own Tiltfile.
#
# Usage:
#   tilt up                    # Run all sub-projects
#   tilt up dagster-congress   # Run only dagster-congress
#   tilt up memex              # Run only memex
#
# TODO:
#   - Integrate shared resources (Neo4j, MinIO) across services
#   - Add credIT and devsauce once scaffolded
